This project is a single webpage that contains google fonts, a hero background, navigation that changes colour when hovered over. 
Clicking on a navigation item will cause the page to smoothly transition to that section of the page. 
In the top right hand corner we have a Light Mode with an icon of the sun beside a toggle button. when the toggle is changed the entire site transitions to Dark Mode with the sun icon changing to a moon. This change is reflected in the images on site (which also change colour) along with the background and navigiation and hover effects too.

It uses Flexbox, HTML5, CSS, and JS

It can be used as an example of 

- Single page for a website 


NOTE: This project is not overly responsive - it is more about displaying the light/ dark mode
